# Trustware

## Overview
Trustware is a **programmable identity-routing infrastructure** that solves crypto’s fundamental fragmentation problem.  
It enables any asset to be sent from any chain and automatically delivered in the recipient’s preferred format—turning complex multi-step blockchain operations into simple payment instructions that work everywhere, instantly, and without integration complexity.

While others focus on trading, backend settlement, or rebuilding entire systems, Trustware delivers the entire user journey from **initial deposit to final delivery** in one unified orchestration layer.

---

## Key Value Proposition
- **Universal routing layer:** Send any asset from any chain, receive in any format.
- **Zero integration:** Works with existing wallets and protocols with minimal setup.
- **Programmable endpoints:** Create payment links or widgets that auto-route assets to their destination.
- **Cross-chain intelligence:** Optimize for cost, speed, and reliability in real time.
- **Non-custodial by design:** Trustware never holds user funds.

---

## Solutions by User Type

### For End Users
One payment link that works with **any wallet, any token, any chain**.  
No more explaining which network to use or losing clients due to address confusion.

**Example:**  
Share your `trustware.io/pay` link and get paid in seconds.

### For dApps
Stop losing users at the deposit screen.  
Add Trustware’s deposit widget to accept assets from any chain in 5 minutes.

- Stripe-simple deposits  
- Revenue from routing fees  
- No cross-chain maintenance or bridge setup

### For Institutions
Transform blockchain rails into **programmable payment infrastructure** for treasury and settlement automation.

- Institutional routing and liquidity management  
- Automated stablecoin conversion  
- Policy-based compliance routing and reporting

---

## How Trustware Works

### 1. Programmable Identity Layer
Each user or institution receives a **private endpoint** that houses routing preferences, settlement logic, and payment policies.  
These aren’t simple addresses—they’re programmable instructions that automatically execute complex cross-chain operations.

### 2. Intelligent Routing Engine
The routing engine analyzes 70+ blockchains and 1,000+ assets in real time to determine optimal routes for any transaction.  
It selects bridges, DEXs, and liquidity sources based on **speed**, **cost**, and **reliability**.

### 3. Zero-Integration Infrastructure
Trustware can be embedded in minutes. Drop a single line of code into your application to start accepting deposits from any chain and any asset—no smart contract modifications required.

---

## Built on Proven Infrastructure
Trustware leverages production-grade cross-chain infrastructure:

- **Axelar GMP:** $11B+ processed with enterprise-grade validator security  
- **Squid Router:** Liquidity aggregation and deep pool routing  
- **Blockscope:** Real-time compliance and transaction monitoring  

---

## Why Trustware

| Competitor Type | Limitation | Trustware Advantage |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| Bridge Aggregators | Provide routing APIs only; dApps must build UX and logic | End-to-end orchestration and UI components |
| Naming Services | Human-readable addresses only; no routing or conversion | Programmable routing and settlement logic |
| Account Abstraction Wallets | Works only within proprietary wallets | Wallet-agnostic, universal compatibility |

---

## Use Cases

Trustware solves cross-chain fragmentation across **DeFi, business payments, and institutional infrastructure**.

### DeFi & dApp Integration
Enable deposits from users across all chains through a single API. Trustware automates bridging, routing, and settlement.

### Universal Payment Settlement
Accept payments from any chain and automatically receive them in your preferred asset and chain.

### Institutional Treasury Management
Automate treasury conversions, routing, and cold storage deposits with programmable policies.

### Remittances
Enable cross-border stablecoin remittances using existing mobile or banking infrastructure.

### Crypto Cards
Allow card users to fund with any token, any chain. Trustware converts and delivers to the card’s funding network.

### Compliance-First Market Making
Institutions can specify whitelisted liquidity providers for regulatory compliance.

### Automated Liquidity Management
Rebalance funds and maintain portfolio exposure automatically using programmable rules.

## Advanced Technical Use Cases

- **Cross-Chain Yield Optimization** — Automatically migrate liquidity between chains based on APY differentials.  
- **Batch Payment Distribution** — Execute mass payouts to hundreds of addresses across multiple chains with one signature.  
- **Cross-Chain Collateral Management** — Accept collateral from any chain and settle atomically on your protocol’s base chain.  
- **Intent-Based Trading Execution** — Execute conditional multi-chain trades automatically when triggers are met.  
- **Subscription & Recurring Payments** — Enable recurring payments with delegated authorization and automatic routing.  
- **Programmatic Treasury Sweeping** — Consolidate multi-chain revenue into one wallet on schedule.  
- **Liquidation Protection** — Provide instant cross-chain credit for emergency collateral top-ups.  
- **NFT Auction Settlement** — Allow multi-chain bids and atomic settlement for NFT sales.  
- **Automated Arbitrage Execution** — Exploit cross-chain price differentials safely.  
- **Portfolio Rebalancing** — Maintain portfolio allocations automatically.  
- **Conditional Payments** — Execute milestone-based payments triggered by oracles or off-chain data.  
- **Gas Abstraction for dApps** — Let users pay fees in any token, not just native gas.  
- **Institutional RFQ Fulfillment** — Enable large compliant cross-chain transfers with guaranteed settlement.

---

## Technical Differentiators
- **Atomic Execution:** Multi-step transactions execute completely or revert fully.  
- **Intent-Based Architecture:** Users define outcomes, not execution paths.  
- **Slippage Protection:** Guaranteed minimum output across the route.  
- **MEV Resistance:** Private routing prevents front-running.  
- **Gas Optimization:** Route selection minimizes costs globally.  
- **Programmability:** Complex conditional rules, executed automatically.  
- **Compliance-Ready:** Full audit trails and whitelisting.

## Architecture Overview

### Non-Custodial Model
Trustware never holds user funds.  
Transactions execute through secure, audited smart contracts on Axelar GMP.

| Security Layer | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| **Axelar GMP** | Decentralized validator network handling cross-chain messaging |
| **Atomic Execution** | Transactions succeed or fail as a single unit |
| **On-Chain Settlement** | All delivery and confirmation occur on-chain |
| **User Custody** | Senders maintain control until transaction completion |

Even if Trustware’s UI goes offline, routing contracts continue operating independently, ensuring no funds are ever lost.

---

## Gas Abstraction and Optimization
- Users complete cross-chain payments without holding gas tokens.  
- Transactions are batched to reduce fees.  
- Gas intelligence monitors network prices and delays non-urgent transactions.  
- Users save up to 40% on gas costs.

---

## MEV Protection
Trustware employs:
- **Private Transaction Routing**
- **Flashbots Integration**
- **Sandwich Attack Prevention**
- **Front-running Resistance**

---

## Security & Compliance
### Infrastructure Security
- Built on Axelar Proof-of-Stake validator network  
- Audited cross-chain bridges and smart contracts  
- Real-time AML and threat monitoring (Blockscope)

### Compliance Features
- Address whitelisting and blacklisting  
- Audit-ready reporting  
- Configurable rulesets per integration

---

## Email Notifications
Every transaction triggers automated confirmation emails for both parties.

**Sender Details**
- Amount sent  
- Source chain and asset  
- Transaction hash  
- Route summary  

**Recipient Details**
- Amount received  
- Destination chain  
- Confirmation timestamp
